# Quantitative Global Soundscape Analysis
At tropical latitudes life diversity is at it's highest, and nowhere else on earth the acoustic environment is more dynamic. Insects, amphibians, birds and mammals use acoustic signals to communicate over long distances through the dense vegetation. Their songs and calls are mixed down into the environment creating a complex and fascinating soundscape. How to decipher this acoustic environment to address ecological questions? This project compiles a range of tools to objectively quantify tropical soundscapes in order to identify key patterns related to animal diversity.
